# 0001. Source Control decisions

Date: 2021-10-11

## Status

Active

## Context

It is critical that our teams have a well-defined way to communicate and collaborate on engineering artifacts. How teams work together on their artifacts in source control is key to the broader success.

## Decision

The Tailspin Space Game project will have all engineering deliverables in a single repository. This includes, but isn't limited to:

* Application Source
* Infrastructure as Code
* Configuration as Code
* Documentation as Code

## Consequences

All team members need to be thoughtful of other team membersâ€™ needs and regularly reflect on where they place their artifacts and try to make it as intuitive.
